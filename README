Pyminc is a python interface to the MINC 2 library, allowing use of numpy arrays to 
access MINC data, and other such similar goodies developed by Jason Lerch.

*****

Requirements:

Pyminc requires numpy (the python numerical arrays package) to work. Also, it needs 
MINC2 compiled as a shared object and accessible through the standard search paths

*****

Installing pyminc:

1) Untar the tarball if applicable

2) Run 'python setup.py install' with an optinal --prefix if you want to install it in a non-default location

3) Test the installation. To test the installation of pyminc library, run the pyminc_test2.py script in the
scripts folder. This program has 3 arguments: a minc file, a method for smoothing the volume (numpy, blitz or weave)
and an output file name
